# System

The System CLI application is a part of the MathSwe Ops MVP to automate software
operations in Linux, such as installation, uninstallation, and configuration,
allowing you to set up server VMs and desktop Workstations by running a command.

## MathSwe Ops System MVP

The System MVP provides robust engineering for the essential
(i.e., "Minimum" of MVP) modules while aiming to evolve into the
engineering-grade version, following MathSwe standards for MVPs.

These standards include ensuring the robustness of essential modules,
maintaining a workflow suitable for a pre-release yet stable project (i.e.,
`v0.y.z`, relatively stable), and eventually devising its DSL (Domain Specific
Language) that gives it the engineering grade while the MVP is already serving
in production.

MathSwe Ops System MVP is an application with a reliable and evolving design
that makes cloud VMs and desktop work machines productive from cold OS
installation. It automates cold-start DevOps and staff onboarding as per your
organization's standards.
